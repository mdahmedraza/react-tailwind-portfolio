                  <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>I have spent the last 3 years in this field as a learner and and i am 
                      creating some projects. I have always had a knack for technology and 
                      working with computers. In 2021 I started working with HTML & CSS to 
                      make some minor edits on a small business website. What i thought was 
                      just a few small edits turned into a love for programming.
                  </p>
                  <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
                      Fascinated with how intericate programming can be I was quickly drawn 
                      to learn more. I started learning javascript and was more enthused with 
                      making websites interactive. I am now spending my time building projects 
                      with React js, Node js, Firebase, and learning new technologies.
